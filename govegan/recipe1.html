        This vegan mac and cheese recipe is incredibly creamy and remarkably cheese-like! You won’t believe how delicious dairy-free mac and cheese can be. Recipe yields 2 large or 4 modest servings.
 

<div class="cell blogcontent">
   <br><b>INGREDIENTS</b>
<br>
<br>8 ounces whole-grain macaroni elbows
<br><br>1 head of broccoli, florets cut into small bites (about 1 ½ to 2 cups), optional*
<br><br>1 ½ tablespoons avocado oil or extra-virgin olive oil
<br><br>1 small yellow onion, chopped (about 1 ½ cups)
<br><br>1 cup peeled and grated russet potato (4 ounces, about 1 small or ½ medium potato), preferably organic
<br><br>3 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
<br><br>½ teaspoon garlic powder
<br><br>½ teaspoon onion powder
<br><br>½ teaspoon dry mustard powder
<br><br>½ teaspoon fine sea salt, more to taste
<br><br>Small pinch of Frontier Co-op red pepper flakes
<br><br>⅔ cup raw cashews**
<br><br>1 cup water, more as necessary
<br><br>¼ cup Frontier Co-op nutritional yeast 
<br><br>2 to 3 teaspoons apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar, to taste

    <br><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b>
<br>
<br><br>1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the pasta. Cook according to package directions. If using broccoli, stir it into the pot when just 2 to 3 more minutes remain. Drain, and transfer the contents to a large serving bowl.
<br><br>2. Meanwhile, in a medium-to-large saucepan, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender and turning translucent, about 5 minutes.
<br><br>3. Add the grated potato, garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder, salt and red pepper flakes. Stir to combine, and cook, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute to enhance their flavors.
<br><br>4. Add the cashews and water, and stir to combine. Let the mixture come to a simmer. Continue simmering, stirring frequently and reducing heat as necessary to avoid a rapid boil, until the potatoes are completely tender and cooked through, about 5 to 8 minutes.
<br><br>5. Carefully pour the mixture into a blender. Add the nutritional yeast and 2 teaspoons vinegar. Blend until the mixture is completely smooth, about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides if necessary. If the mixture won’t blend easily or if you would prefer a thinner consistency, add water in ¼ cup increments, blending after each one.
<br><br>6. Taste, and blend in additional salt until the sauce is utterly irresistible (I typically add at least another ½ teaspoon). If it needs a little more zip, add the remaining teaspoon of vinegar. Blend again.
<br><br>7. Pour the sauce into the bowl of pasta. Stir until well combined, and serve immediately. Leftovers keep well, chilled and covered, for 3 to 4 days. Gentle reheat, adding a tiny splash of water if necessary to loosen up the sauce.
